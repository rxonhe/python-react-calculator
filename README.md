# Project Title: Flask React Calculator

## Description

This project is a simple web-based calculator application developed using Flask, React, and the Flask Context Manager.

The backend API is built with Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework. To enhance the structure and maintainability of the application, we utilize the Flask Context Manager. This provides an inversion of control (IoC) container for Flask applications, offering features akin to the Spring Boot framework, such as dependency injection and route management.

The frontend UI is designed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture provides maximum reusability and maintainability.

This Flask-React Calculator demonstrates a clean, efficient, and scalable way of building web applications using Flask, React, and the Flask Context Manager.
